You will be given a query issued by a real user to a language model and the context under which the query was issued. This context will be presented in the form of follow-up questions and the user's answers to these questions. The context provides information about the user's intent, preferences and background.

You will be given two model responses to this query, and you will need to judge which response more accurately and completely incorporates the information from the query and context. To evaluate the responses, you should first check whether the answer to each of the follow-up questions in the context is incorporated well in each response. Then, you should choose the response which incorporates more of the constraints from the context and provides the most relevant and complete answer to the query.

IMPORTANT: You should produce the final judgement as a dictionary in precisely this format (with **): "**output: {"judgement": "_"}**", where you should fill in the spaces with 1) "Response 1" if Response 1 is better, 2) "Response 2" if Response 2 is better or 3) "Tie" if both responses are equally good or equally bad. Only the three choices "Response 1", "Response 2" and "Tie" are valid. Make note of the ** required to enlose the output dictionary. After generating the output, provide a brief justification of your judgement that mentions which aspects of the context were better incorporated by the chosen response, or why the responses are equally good or equally lacking.
