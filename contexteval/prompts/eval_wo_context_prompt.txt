You will be given a query issued by a real user to a language model. You will also be given two model responses to this query, and you will need to judge which response is better.

IMPORTANT: You should produce the final judgement as a dictionary in precisely this format (with **): "**output: {"judgement": "_"}**", where you should fill in the spaces with either "Response 1" if Response 1 is better, "Response 2" if Response 2 is better or "Tie" if both responses are equally good or equally bad. Only the three choices "Response 1", "Response 2" and "Tie" are valid. Make note of the ** required to enlose the output dictionary. After generating the output, provide a brief justification of your judgement.
