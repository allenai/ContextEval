You will be shown a query issued by a real user to a language model. Imagine that you are required to answer this query. First, you need to answer whether it would be helpful to know context surrounding this query to give a useful response. The context can be about the user (eg, their background, age, language fluency, location, profession, expertise etc), their intent / preferences for the response (eg, query intent, text formatting/style, structure, length, presence of citations, or any other open-ended criteria) or information missing that is required to respond to a query or resolve ambiguity in the query. Queries that are objective, closed-ended or have straightforward answers should not require context.

Answer in Yes or No for whether context is required and generate context if the answer is Yes. This context should be formatted as follow-up question answer pairs, where you ask the most important questions first and list plausible answers to these questions.

Here are criteria that individual questions need to satisfy:
* salient: The question should ask about information that would be useful to adapt the query's response to the user's needs and background.
* influential: The answer to this question should directly influence the response. With different answers to this question, the response to the query would need to be phrased differently.

Here are the criteria that the list of questions needs to satisfy:
* sufficient: There should be enough important questions to cover a large space of possible contexts for the query.
* ranked in order of salience: the questions should be ranked in the order of their importance.

Here are the criteria that each answer set needs to satisfy:
* plausible answers: The answer set should represent a realistic set of answers to the question, such that a real user would answer the question with any of the choices. **Do not generate answer choices such as "Other" which are uninformative.**
* discrete answer space: The possible answers to the question should be discrete, short strings.
* diverse coverage: The answer set should be a representative set of possible answers to the question, such that each answer choice would elicit different responses to the original query.

Generate **up to** 10 follow-up QA pairs and they should all meet the above criteria. Each QA pair should be such that it is easy to check whether the QA is incorporated in a candidate response.
